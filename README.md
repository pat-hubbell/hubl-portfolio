# My Personal Portfolio Website

### Motivation
I began this project in order to gain some more web development experience, to learn about ReactJS, and to give my peers an introduction of myself and the personal personal projects I've recently been working on. Since I wanted to learn more about React, I chose to use GatsbyJS as my static site generator since I knew this would be a very small-scale website. I recently took a React Native course and learned to style my UI components within the same files where the components were built. I decided I wanted a CSS styling experience similar to how I styled components in my React Native course, so I used the styled-components library. This project taught me a lot about making a website responsive to different devices sizes from scratch.
